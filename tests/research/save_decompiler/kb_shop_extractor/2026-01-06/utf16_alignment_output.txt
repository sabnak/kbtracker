ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Chunk size: 10000 bytes
Is chunk size even (UTF-16 aligned): True
Chunk start position: 520000
Is chunk start even (UTF-16 aligned): True

Conclusion:
  Chunk starts on even boundary (GOOD for UTF-16-LE)

UTF-16-LE encoding uses 2 bytes per character. When we decode a chunk with
'errors=ignore', characters that are split across the boundary will be
corrupted or interpreted differently.

In this case, when decoding the chunk from 520000-530000:
- The string 'itext_m_zcom_start_519_terr' is near the end of the chunk
- Due to malformed UTF-16 at the boundary, the decoder might produce
  corrupted output that causes the regex to match 'itext_m_zcom_start_5'
  instead of the full '519'
